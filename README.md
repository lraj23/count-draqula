# Count Draqula

### Main Purpose

The point of this bot is to regulate [#counttoamillionnomistakes](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/CQ8G37TSL) and ensure that the rules of the channel are followed, as well as to verify that all numbers counted are correct. Additionally, this is supposed to allow you to jumpscare people counting :scheme:.

### Commands

Since this bot is intended to have a good amount of features, it includes a couple of commands.

#### /cdraqula-shop
This command allows you to buy stuff from the shop. Currently, the items available are: jumpscares, an elusive test item, and admin privileges. Jumpscares cost 3 currency, and buying them allows you to choose someone to jumpscare or to cancel existing jumpscares (if there are any). When someone gets jumpscared, the bot reacts to their next correct number with the fear emoji and sends them [a jumpscare gif](https://i.redd.it/go7ir6novo8f1.gif). The elusive test item is elusive and a test, so no more information is available about it. Finally, the admin privileges cost 100 currency, and buying them makes the purchaser an admin if they aren't already; then gives them the option to make more people admin.

#### /cdraqula-admin
This command allows admins to access the admin panel, and allows nonadmins to request the admins to override the current number. The admin panel consists of four options. The first is to override the current number, which allows admins to adjust for possible bugs and problems that incorrectly reset the number. Then there are the add admin and remove admin options, which do as they say. Finally, there is the cancel button, which just closes the panel.

#### /cdraqula-help
This command helps you navigate this bot. It basically redirects you to this repository though, so no need to run it after seeing it here.

### Links, Channels, etc.

The dedicated channel for using this bot is [#counttoamillionnomistakes](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/CQ8G37TSL). In order to become an admin, either grind (not suggested) or just ask me (@lraj23) and I'll (most likely) make you an admin! The GitHub repo is literally [right here](https://www.github.com/lraj23/count-draqula). My Hackatime project for this bot is called count-draqula.
